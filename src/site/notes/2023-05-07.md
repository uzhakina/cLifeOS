Chat GPT please help me to correct audio message text to my friend about my last month:
Hi Olga, long time no hear you. So I'm happy to record this audio message for you again. I'm somehow fall of the wagon because I had a really busy weeks at work and I even didn't have time to do my education. So I needed time to rest and every day I thought okay today I will record a message to Olga and than in the evening in the bed I thought "Oh, no, I I'm forgot it. I forgot it again!"" 
I hope you are fine. And I hope you enjoying our holidays.  
I use this holiday to catch up with our program because I was not in line with schedule  from one hand. And from other hand I am very keen on using Power BI Tools for my reports.  I have an idea to present my manager new report in power bi file after this holiday on Wednesday. Therefor I spent previous days to learn as much as I can about Power BI functions. And tomorrow and thу day after tomorrow I'll try to recreate my dashboards that currently in Excel files. I want to create them in Power BI files so I can share this program with my manager and I hope she would like it and give me approval to try to use it for other reports. 
So this my last month activities, and I'm happy to be out from home again. On Wednesday will be my first day when I go to work physically because before it I was working from home and I gain weight literally and I didn't move physically, so I feel very heavy and not trained and it's so difficult for me now to move. 
I hope to get back into just a little bit more fit and more healthy body. 
I hope May will be very interesting and healthy month for me. 
Looking forward to hear how are you doing? And what are you doing on holidays? 
Bye. See you

Hi Olga, it's great to talk to you again after a long time. I apologize for not keeping in touch with you earlier. I've been really busy with work lately and haven't had much time to focus on anything else. I hope you're doing well and enjoying your holidays.

During my time off, I decided to catch up with our education program because I had fallen behind on the schedule. Additionally, I've been interested in using Power BI Tools for my reports at work, and I wanted to present a new report to my manager using this software. So, I've been spending my time learning as much as I can about Power BI functions and recreating my Excel dashboards in Power BI files. I hope that my manager likes it and approves of it for other reports in the future.

I'm excited to go back to work physically on Wednesday because I've been working from home for a while now, and I've gained weight as a result of not moving around enough. I feel heavy and untrained, so I'm looking forward to getting back into a more fit and healthy body.

I hope May brings me more interesting and healthy activities and experiences. How about you? How are you doing, and what are you up to during the holidays?

Take care, and talk to you soon. Bye.

Hi Olga, it's great to record an audio message for you again after a while. I'm sorry for the delay, but work has been really busy lately and I've been struggling to find time for anything else.

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the holidays. As for me, I've been using this time to catch up on our education program, as I had fallen behind schedule. I've also been learning about Power BI Tools to create new reports for my manager. I plan to present a new report to her on Wednesday, and I hope she'll approve of it so I can use it for other reports as well.

Next, I'm happy to go back to work physically on Wednesday since I've been working from home and feeling heavy and not trained. I gained some weight, and it's been difficult for me to move, so I want to get back into a more fit and healthy body.

I hope May will be an interesting and healthy month for me. How about you? How are you doing and what have you been up to during the holidays?

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Bye for now!
