Chat GPT please help me to correct audio message text to my friend about my day:
Hi Olga, how are you? How was your week yesterday? I was an English lesson in our course, but there was a lot of people from beginners  group. So it was a little bit easy for me and I was a little bit disappointed because there was a lot of Russian language and a lot of grammar, but I prefer to speak with people not to learn grammar because when I think about grammar I can speak but if I want to express myself to share information, it's easy for me to speak and don't worry about grammar. I know maybe it's too much. Don't worry about grammar at all. But the lesson was a little bit boring for me. So today I want to record this audio for you and practice English.  Also, I participated in survey that has been provided in our course and I wrote that I want more English lessons about data about information about business analytics and not General English lessons because I can get them if I want in other English schools, like Skyeng. Also this week is very busy for me because it's budgeting Period and also tomorrow will be the day when I will have meeting with my manager and other colleagues about my probation period And I have created PowerPoint presentation about the results for last  three - four months as I'm working in this company. So I'm a little bit nervous, but I think it will be fine. It's  will be great if I can meet with you on weekend and discuss our Progress in English and I also can share with you this presentation and show you some reports I have created. So I can share it with you on the screen in telegram, but I can send send you anything just to share some ideas I have implemented in my work. I didn't do any lessons in our course because it's like too much on my plate now and I am looking forward as always to know how are you and how it how is your week? Bye see you.

Hi Olga,

How are you doing? How was your week? Yesterday, I attended an English lesson in our course, but there were a lot of people from the beginners group, so it was a little bit too easy for me. I was slightly disappointed because there was a lot of focus on the Russian language and grammar, but I prefer to speak with people rather than just focus on grammar. When I think too much about grammar, I tend to speak slower. I find it easier to express myself and share information when I don't worry too much about grammar. I hope that doesn't sound like too much information. Don't worry about grammar at all. However, the lesson was a little bit boring for me. That's why I decided to record this audio message for you today to practice my English.

I also participated in a survey provided in our course, and I indicated that I would like more English lessons related to data, information, and business analytics rather than general English lessons. I can get general English lessons from other English schools like Skyeng. This week has been very busy for me because it's budgeting period. Tomorrow, I have a meeting with my manager and colleagues about my probation period. I created a PowerPoint presentation about the results for the last three to four months since I started working in this company. I'm a bit nervous, but I think it will be fine.

It would be great if we could meet this weekend and discuss our progress in English. I can also share my presentation with you and show you some reports I've created. I can share my screen on Telegram so you can see it. However, I cannot send you anything, but I can share some ideas I have implemented in my work. I didn't attend any lessons in our course this week because I have a lot on my plate now. As always, I'm looking forward to hearing from you about how your week went.

Bye for now, and see you soon.
