1Ô∏è‚É£ Create your chart.  
  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a transparent overlay object. You'll need to adjust the color fill of the object so it's transparent (e.g., black with 80% transparency).  
  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Create another object for the spotlight area. Position it where you'd like to create the spotlight.  
  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Select both of the objects by clicking on the transparent object first and then, while holding the shift key, select the spotlight object. From the Format Shapes menu, select "Fragment" under "Merge Shapes. This action will cause the spotlight object to be cut out of the overlay object.  
  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Delete the unwanted spotlight object. Voila! You have a spotlight overlay for your chart.  
  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: Add a fade animation to bring in the spotlight for emphasis.
