Chat GPT please help me to correct audio message text to my friend about my day:
Hi Olga, sorry for not recording messages for you. And for me I didn't have any practice in English. So I'm happy to record this short message.It's a busy season for me because it's first time when I am participating in budgeting process and there are a lot of data to analyze. It's just first time for me to analyze data for  HR department. So it's something new for me and it's nine o'clock and I'm still in the process of analyzing that data and creating tables and graphs because  tomorrow at 11 I have a meeting with my manager and I have to be ready for it. And the second task is I volunteer to create a dashboard for production department. So I do it on my weekends and after work because it's not a part of my job, so I cannot use working hours to create it.  I did it on weekend and I am planning next week to have a meeting with head of production department  to discuss with her what she wants to see on the dashboard and  what she wants to correct.  I have created draft version of this dashboard and I know she's not very happy about it. So this is my week a lot of work and looking forward to Wednesday when I can speak in English in our club. Thank you, and looking forward to hear from you. Bye.

Hi Olga, I apologize for not sending any messages to you lately. I'm glad to be recording this short message for you now. It's a busy season for me because it's the first time I'm participating in the budgeting process, and there's a lot of data to analyze. This is the first time I'm analyzing data for the HR department, so it's something new for me. It's currently 9 pm, and I'm still in the process of analyzing the data, creating tables, and graphs because I have a meeting with my manager at 11 am tomorrow, and I have to be ready for it. My second task is to create a dashboard for the production department. I volunteer to do this task on weekends and after work because it's not part of my job, and I can't use work hours to create it. I already created a draft version of the dashboard, and next week, I'm planning to have a meeting with the head of the production department to discuss what she wants to see on the dashboard and what changes she wants me to make. I know that she's not very happy with the current draft version of the dashboard. This is my busy week, and I'm looking forward to Wednesday when we can speak in English in our club. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Bye.
