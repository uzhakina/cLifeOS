## Transcript

Like any industry **business intelligence** has its own jargon and terms that can be confusing if you're unfamiliar with them. In this video i'm going to **break down** seven of the most common terms in bi that everyone should know.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Term number one a **data silo** is a **standalone source of data** that's not connected to any others or to a **centralized data repository**. 
Basically most businesses generate tons of data in different places through all of their different activities from simple excel files and **on-premise databases** to social media profiles and web SaaS services. You can even have different data silos within different departments of the same company, so sales marketing finance etc could all be using different internal systems that collect data and store it separately from the rest. 
One of the **basic premises** of business intelligence is to **harness all of the data** from these different data silos and either to use tools **to query the data** where it is and **join or blend it with other data** from other sources or transfer that data from there to a **centralized repository** which *brings us nicely onto the next term.*

2Ô∏è‚É£ A **[[Data Warehouse\|Data Warehouse]]** is a kind of database that as the name suggests warehouses data that's been extracted from different places or silos. Its purpose is to bring all of this data together to serve the analysis processes of business intelligence. 
Data warehouses contain a copy of current and historical data from different sources. Which means that they **can be built and configured** to make analysis faster and easier while not getting in the way of the original data source which is busy collecting data. Because the data is **being extracted from its original source** and loaded into the warehouse this means that in between the two the **data can be cleaned and transformed** to make it more compatible with the data model that **best suits the business** it serves.

3Ô∏è‚É£ *Next up* we have [[ETL - extract transform and load\|ETL - extract transform and load]] which is a tool that's named after the three tasks it performs. Those three tasks being the ones that we just talked about with data warehouses. ETL stands for extract transform and load so basically its job is to take data from one place then apply transformations to it before loading it into another place. It essentially solves two of the **main issues surrounding the data** part of the business intelligence process. 
Firstly that data is everywhere in silos that aren't necessarily connected to one another. ETLs allow you to bring all of these different data sources together into one place like a data warehouse. Secondly data can be in many different formats like a table in a database or json xml csv among others. The transform functionalities of an ETL allow you to **standardize and normalize all of these different data formats** making them far easier to blend together and analyze together. Another important function of ETLs is to clean data by fixing any errors that may exist in the **original data source** which in turn ensures that the data and the **results of data analysis are more reliable.**

4Ô∏è‚É£ [[RDBMS - relational database management system\|RDBMS - relational database management system]] stands for **relational database management system** it's software that's used to manage and administer relational databases. The most widely known of these are [[MySQL\|MySQL]], SQL Server and Postgresql or if you're "Old school" [[Microsoft Access\|Microsoft Access]]. 
Data warehouses are relational databases so you need an rdbms **to manage and query it**. 

![Pasted image 20230318144126.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020230318144126.png)If you're not familiar with what a [[Relational database\|Relational database]] is, it's a **database made up of different data sets** that are contained in what are called tables because the data is in a tabular rows and columns [[Tabular format\|Tabular format]] .The reason it's called relational is that every one of these tables has a relationship to one or more other tables. This relationship takes the form of one or more **common data fields** that contain the same information. They're called **[[Joining keys\|Joining keys]]**. Structuring a database like this is an efficient way of storing data and makes data analysis faster.

5Ô∏è‚É£ [[SQL\|SQL]] often pronounced sql stands for **structured query language**. It's a language that communicates with relational databases or rdbms. So in terms of business intelligence the sql language is used to query databases and ask them to aggregate and filter data contained in its tables, also to join different tables together. Most bi tools have some kind of sql query engine behind them to carry out these tasks. each rdbms mysql sql server etc has its own version of sql that differs slightly from others in terms of its syntax. But on the whole they're very very similar.

6Ô∏è‚É£ [[KPI\|KPI]] stands for key performance indicator. They're metrics or values that help businesses measure their performance or success in achieving their objectives. KPIs will vary depending on the nature of the business activity and they could be high level measuring the overall performance of a company or focus on specific aspects of a specific activity like marketing finance sales or website traffic. KPIs are a very important part of business intelligence.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Next up we have [[Dashboard\|Dashboard]] . Now these are the EndProduct if you like of the business intelligence process. Dashboards are reports that offer an **at a glance snapshot** of a business's KPIs and aggregated data. It's this **at a glance** characteristic that differentiates dashboards from **traditional reports** which tend to **be more narrative in nature**. Dashboards are single screen reports that are often, though not always, connected to live data and are being constantly updated. Whereas a car dashboard displays things like how fast you're going how much is left in the tank or the outside temperature a business intelligence dashboard displays things like revenue, stock levels, and social media engagement. 

## Summary

[[Data Silo\|Data Silo]] -  standalone source of data that's **not connected** to any others or to a centralized data repository. Can be different Data Silos for different departments (data keeps separately from the rest).

**One of the basic premises** of [[BI-—Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã\|business intelligence]] is **to harness all of the data** from these different data silos
